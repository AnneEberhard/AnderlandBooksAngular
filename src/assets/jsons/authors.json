                "But then, shortly before her retirement, the twins Philipp and Katharina were born. And when they turned five, Grandma Sigrid wrote the first Fips and Nina stories for her grandchildren, in which their favorite dolls experience many adventures. These became several books, which she had printed exclusively for the family.",
