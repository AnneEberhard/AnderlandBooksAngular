And when they turned five, Grandma Sigrid wrote the first Fips and Nina stories for her grandchildren, in which their favorite dolls experience many adventures. These became several books, which she had printed exclusively for the family.",

Whether caught in the slipstream of war, or through other demanding predicaments, his characters never give up on life. After all, what would a story be without high challenge?

She also terribly despises badly researched stories and black-and-white telling. With her, you get no perfect heroes and no dastardly villains, either, because this is, to her experience, just not how life works...",
